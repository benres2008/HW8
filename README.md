  ## Usage: 
  This app is used to generate a README for the user. I am using it right now to write this! Users are prompted with a series of questions that they must answer about an application that they have developed, and then when they are done answering the questions, their input is stored ina file that is there new README.

  ## Testing:
  To test this application, you can open the code in terminal, type "node index.js", and see what happens:)

  ## Installation:
  You do not need to install anything for this app. All of the code is written for the user and requires no installation

  ## Issues:
  You can report issues by contacting me personally at my email

  ## Contributions:
